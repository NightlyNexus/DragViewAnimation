DragViewAnimation
=================

Emulating YouTube's video drag animation.

This is my first experience with more advanced animations.  Also, my first experience using Android Studio!
Drag the picture to the bottom of the screen and interact with it just like the YouTube app.  Note that this ImageView can be replaced by any View of your choosing.  Enjoy!
